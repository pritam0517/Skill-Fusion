            <h2 className='heads'>About Skill Fusion</h2>
              <p>Welcome to Skill Fusion, the ultimate platform for coding enthusiasts!
                We're thrilled to have you here. Whether you're a seasoned coder or just starting 
                your coding journey, you've found your new digital home</p>


              <h2 className='heads'>Vision</h2>
                <p>At Skill Fusion, the mission is simple: to foster a vibrant and inclusive coding 
                  community where individuals of all skill levels can connect, learn, and collaborate. 
                  We believe that coding is more than just lines of text; it's a language that unites people
                   with a shared passion for innovation and problem-solving</p>

                <h2 className='heads'>Mission</h2>
                  <p>Our journey began with a simple idea: to create a 
                    space where coders from around the world could come together,
                    share their experiences, and grow together. It started with a
                    small group of like-minded individuals who were passionate about 
                    coding's power to change the world. Today, we've evolved into a thriving 
                    community that empowers coders of all backgrounds and abilities.</p>
